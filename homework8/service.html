            <h4>PNC Service Design Project</h4>

            <br />
            In my Service Design class (under the Human-Computer Interaction Institute), we were tasked with a client, PNC Bank, to create a solution in order to co-create value between them and their target customer: local teenagers. My team met with two PNC representatives consistently throughout the semester and with guidance from our instructors John Zimmerman and Jodi Forlizzi to create a final porposal that included a prototype, research document, service blueprint, and customer journey map.

                      <br /><h5>Teammates</h5>

            <!-- <div class = "caption-card"> -->
          
            <h5>Client Prompt</h5>
            <i>Conceive of and design future services that leverage data to help parents and teens have a dialogue about family finances. 
            Explore how to offer bundled services that benefit families by enabling them to save, budget, and realize their financial goals. </i>

            <br /><br />
            <h3 class = "semibold">Phase 1: Discovery</h3>
            In the discovery phase, we started first with secondary research to get a general sense of the space we were working in. This research was comprised of scholarly articles on financially motivations in teens as well as financial education, as well evaluations of current products and the use behidn them. We then moved next into some basic interviews with local teens and parents in our community. 

            <h5>Research Findings</h5>
             State mandates requiring high school students to take personal finance courses have no effect on savings or investment behavior. Meanwhile, a person’s personal finance habits are largely learned from his/her parents. Teens between the ages 12-17 get their most of their money from parents in the shape of allowance or cash as needed. They spend most of it on food, clothing and electronics/video games.

            <h5>Interview Findings</h5>

                      <p>Teens: 
            <ul>
                <li>Go to their parents first when they have questions about money. </li>
                <li>Like immediate and tangible connections when it comes to "managing" their finances, such as keeping receipts and calling the bank to ask what  their account balance is.</li>
                <li>Do not explore new bank options. They simply open bank accounts with their parents’ bank. </li>
                <li>Rely on their parents to gain access to cash. </li>
            </ul>

            Parents: 
            <ul>
                <li>Don't know how much to give to the teen for their allowance. </li>
                <li>Want them to make financial decisions independently but also have oversight of their spending habits. </li>
                <li>Hope teens make safe mistakes now before going to college.  </li>
                <li>Unlikely to switch banks for their teen because they are deeply rooted at their current bank. </li>
                <li>Don’t know how to communicate more complex financial concepts in a way that is easy to understand for their teen. </li>
            </ul></p>

            <br />
            From here my team consolidated began synthesizing our findings with models
            in order to get a better understanding of the space around PNC and teens.<br /><br /></div>

          <img class = "is-half respond-half" src = "images/service/model4.jpg"> 
          <br /><br />
          Afterwards we created a final stakeholder map and value flow model: <br />

            <h3 class = "semibold">Phase 2: Design</h3>

            <p>Once we made our stakeholder map, value flow model, and personas, are team went into the problem and collectively brainstormed 30 ideas together. Afterwards we narrowed down to 5 main ideas.

            <h3 class = "semibold">Speed Dating</h3>

            <p>With our five ideas, our team created storyboards and went into the field to speed date with teenagers. We did two rounds of speed dating, the second narrowing down to just three storyboards based off the results of the first. Teens ranged in age from 12-16 and were found in cafes, shops, and around their school. 

            <h5>First Round:</h5>
            Teens loved the idea of a personalized credit
            card where they were able to determine the
            rules with their parents. What they loved most about were
            getting to have a card and being on the
            same page with their parents. They also were excited by our pet idea,
            feeling as though that would make
            finance fun and less intimidating. Parents, on the other hand, liked the
            idea of determining the rules of the
            credit card. They also liked the pets
            idea, but saw little value for them
            personally.
            <br /><br />

            After this round, our team met again and discussed what new service concepts we could introduce or how we couldedit our existing ones that we still felt had both business value for PNC and a clear benefit for teens. Our teamreally wanted to address the needs of PNC and teens through a hybrid solution that utilized physical and digital
            engagement.As a result, we chose to keep the pet idea and we added two ideas to the mix. Once again, we created storyboards for the two additional ideas to prepare for yet another round of speed dating.

            <br /><h5>Second Round</h5></p>
          </div>
          <img class = "is-half respond-half" src = "images/service/story2.png"> 
          <img class = "is-half respond-half" src = "images/service/story3.png"> 
          <!-- <br /><img class = "is-half" src = "images/service/story1.png"> -->
          <div class = "column is-three-fourths center-col">
            <p>

            This round of speed dating continued to validate the debit/credit card and pet idea. The results led us to
            focus more on strengthening the relationship between teens and PNC.
            We decided to commit to the pet idea but expand the concepts and mechanisms so it would appeal to both
            boys and girls. Other changes include making the service an onboarding game for teens from the ages of 13
            to 16. We wanted to serve teens who just opened accounts with PNC and needed guidance on how to use
            their new debit card.

            <h5>Choosing an Idea</h5>

            <h3 class = "semibold">Phase 3: Refine</h3>

            <h5>Service Idea Overview</h5>
             Pocket Pals is a digital financial service that
              connects PNC with teens directly. As mobile
              banking usage rises year over year, it becomes
              ever more important to educate and push teens
              towards better understanding digital currency
              mechanisms. The impact of mobile technology
              on daily interactions is undeniable. And so, PNC
              must move along that shift in communication
              preferences to establish relationships with teens
              as potential lifelong customers.
              <br /><br />Pocket Pals focuses on offering teens financial
              guidance and education in a friendly, personable
              manner. It is an onboarding program that lasts at
              minimum for 2 weeks and finishes within 30
              days, teens download the app upon signing up
              for a new debit card with PNC.

              <br /><img class = "is-half respond-half" src = "images/service/screen1.png"> 
              <img class = "is-half respond-half" src = "images/service/screen2.png"> 

              <br /><h5>Program Details</h5>

              To start using the app, teens choose from 3
              different pals--pet, robot, or dragon--to take
              care of. The pet begins as a baby, and will
              physically grow as teens reflect healthy
              financial habits during the onboarding
              program. The pet tasks the teen with
              becoming familiar with different
              components of the debit card, such as the
              card number, expiration date, security
              code, and using the ATM.<br />

              <img class = "is-full" src = "images/service/three.png"> 

              <br /><br />To teach financial concepts, the pet gives teens tasks
              and short explanations of why those tasks are
              important--such as setting up a college fund or saving
              5% of their allowance for a future “need.” Aside from
              financial concepts the pet also gives some tasks related
              to using an electronic bank account such as depositing
              a check or sharing their account number with their
              parent. Every time the teen makes good financial
              decisions, such as saving a portion of their allowance,
              staying within budgets, or never overdrafting, the pet
              gets a reward and grows in size. Rewards the pet can
              get are snacks, new toys, or the ability to do a new trick.
